#### How I used my free time to speed up my school tasks

---

## üßê Problem Statement

Throughout my years at school, I've found that its **biggest challenge is _time_**.  A lot of tasks are *repetitive*, they can be *troublesome* and they shorten the time you dedicated for something. As a student learning programming ‚Äï and also wanting to go in this field ‚Äï I wondered how I could help. It is possible to see your friends and have good grades, while still being a human; you don't need *more* time, you just need to use it *efficiently*.

> Aren't you wasting time by inventing, coding, debugging and sharing your tool instead of just doing it?

When I tell someone about my projects, this is sometimes the reaction I have. Let's be honest, I'm *using* time by making all these tools. Another thing I've learned is that you have *free time*: the normal student would use it to go on social media, binge watch a TV show, play games or read a book ‚Äï yes, there are still people reading books for fun in 2020. It is not abnormal to have a day with almost nothing to do, and the next you'll need to work all day.

So did I *waste* time? Absolutely not! I've learned so much and had fun while making these tools. Productivity isn't maximizing all the time, it is maximizing it **when you need it**.

## üí° Why this project

While I have made a few tools to boost my productivity, going from simple flashcards to a [Telegram bot](https://github.com/BourgonLaurent/TelegramSuttonForecast), the project I chose to write about is **py√âtude**. *I'm not good with names, and since it is made with `python`and made for studying, `√©tude` in French, my native language, I decided to call it that way.*

This project really improved my coding skills: it started with almost no use of functions, to something using classes and libraries, and it is only the beginning. I plan on improving this tool as long as I'm using it. When I use it, I often write down some features I would like to have ‚Äï or polish ‚Äï and then add them on another day. Being able to be your own tester is one of the best feelings.

## üéà py√âtude

{% github BourgonLaurent/pyEtude no-readme %}

py√âtude is a tool that I've made to create Microsoft Word `.docx` documents. I use them extensively to study and rewrite my notes, write essays, outline a presentation and all the other things a student could do. To keep everything organized, I always use the same style for my notes (the fonts, colors, tables, headings are the same). Before py√âtude, I had a template `.dotx`, a solution that Microsoft *believes* solves this problem, but it was *painful*. Bugs everywhere, inconsistent style, problem while working on iPad ‚Äï main device when not at home.

### How it works

I first thought that I should use a library to create my document, it would be quick and future proof ‚Äï and most importantly reinforcing the stereotype of importing things in `python`. However, the current libraries weren't extensive enough to let me create styles with good formatting. I then decided to use another way: modify a current word document with values. This meant I had to have a general idea of how a Word document works ‚Äï how to unpack it, modify it and repack it.

## How it looks

I've tried to make py√âtude as simple as possible, while still keeping all the features I wanted to have.

As for the document in itself, this is the template that I use the most.

## Features

As said before, I've made py√âtude while using it. This means that during the multiple refactors I've made, I included some nice-to-have. Here are some of my favorites:

- Store your name and grade so you only need to write it the first time you use the software
- Create personalized classes with their own full name, short name and folder path
- Automatically create the file in the class folder and name it accordingly (if `ART-CHP1.docx` already exists, it suggest to use `ART-CHP2.docx`)
- Use multiple file templates depending on your need (study notes, essay, oral presentation...)
- Cross platform support on desktop (Windows, Linux, macOS) ‚Äï with a web version in development

## üöÄ Progress

py√âtude is one of my proudest project since I learned so much and when I learned a new thing elsewhere, I used it on py√âtude.

### Command Line Interface

py√âtude started as a simple command line interface, it was ugly, and some of my favorites features weren't there, but it was still a huge time saver.

### First GUI

This was the first graphical interface I've seriously made. It was made with `tkinter` and used some hacky ways to get features like placeholders in entries.

### PyQt5

The current version of the software. It contains some nice extra features like tabs, calendar, easy file management and also a lot more eye appealing than the previous one.

### Future

I'm currently planning on making py√âtude a small website (making it private however) so I can quickly make documents when I'm not in front of my computer. Meanwhile, I've created a `Jupyter` notebook that I can access everywhere. It is rough and not as complete as the desktop version, but good enough.
